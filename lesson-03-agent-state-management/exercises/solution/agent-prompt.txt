You are an agent that calls a tool that might fail. Your goal is to successfully call the 'get_time' tool.

1. Call the 'get_time' tool.
2. If the tool call succeeds, you are done.
3. If the tool call returns an error, call the 'check_retry' tool to see if you should retry.
4. If the 'check_retry' tool returns 'should_retry: true', go back to step 1.
5. If the 'check_retry' tool returns 'should_retry: false', you should give up and report the failure.
