# cd14768 - Lesson 8 - demo
Implementing Single-Agent RAG with ADK and Vertex AI Search

- Objective: Demonstrate how to build a RAG agent that retrieves information from unstructured financial documents indexed in Vertex AI Agent Builder
- Setup
  - Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket and upload the sample PDF files from the `docs` folder
  - Go to Vertex AI Agent Builder (Gen App Builder) in the console
  - Create a new App of type "Custom Search (general)"
  - Create a Data Store, selecting Cloud Storage as the source and "Unstructured documents"
  - Link the Data Store to the App
  - Note the "App ID" (this will be the `DATASTORE_ENGINE_ID`)
  - Note the "Location" (e.g., global)
  - Create or update `.env` with `DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID`, `DATASTORE_LOCATION`, and `DATASTORE_ENGINE_ID`
  - Run `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate
- [datastore.py] Highlight the `search` function
  - Explain the `discoveryengine.SearchServiceClient` initialization
  - Show how the `serving_config` path is constructed
  - Discuss the search `request` dictionary:
    - `page_size`: Controlling number of results
    - `content_search_spec`: Setting `search_result_mode` to `CHUNKS` to get snippets instead of full docs
    - `query_expansion_spec`: Enabling `AUTO` expansion for better synonym matching
  - Show how results are extracted from `result.chunk.content`
- [datastore.py] Highlight the `datastore_search_tool` wrapper
  - Shows how it simplifies the interface for the agent (taking just `search_query`)
  - Reads environment variables to pass to the underlying `search` function
- [agent.py] Show `root_agent` configuration
  - Point out `tools=[datastore_search_tool]`
  - Mention the `instruction` in `agent-prompt.txt` that guides the agent to use the tool for financial questions
- Running the code
  - Start `adk web` in the `lesson-08-single-agent-rag` directory
- Demonstration
  - Open the ADK web interface
  - Ask a question relevant to the uploaded documents (e.g., "What are the risk factors associated with the company?")
  - Observe the agent "Thinking" and calling `datastore_search_tool`
  - Click on the tool call in the trace to see the input query and the returned text chunks
  - Show the final grounded response generated by Gemini
- Conclusion and summary
  - Review how we connected unstructured data in GCS to an agent via Vertex AI Agent Builder
  - Emphasize the ease of adding RAG capabilities using the ADK tool pattern
